Through this blog, i want to share my journey into Software Engineering.

My first ever code was written in `C` on my first class of Basic Algorithm and Programming. The code was written using `Turbo C++` Compiler and it was the origin for all my dreams ever since.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```
